# Pandas

This chapter will go over the key syntatical differences between data analysis in Stata and Python. As much as possible, it will attempt to draw parallels between how Stata and Python conduct their data analyses, pointing out which commands are similar and how they are similar. It will also include a tool for typing in Stata commands and recieving the equivalent Python output.

<!-- For more information, please look at [Python's official page](https://www.python.org/) and [Stata's official page](https://www.stata.com/) respectively. -->
