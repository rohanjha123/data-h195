# Pandas

This chapter will introduce `pandas`, a very popular Python library for interacting with tabular data (aka data that is stored in a table format). It shall start off with how to load in and look at datasets using `pandas`, and then cover how to perform various data processing techniques with them. Note that this chapter is not comprehensive, and we strongly encourage you to practice with `pandas` as a form of learning.
