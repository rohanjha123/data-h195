# Pandas

This chapter will introduce `pandas`, a very popular Python library for interacting with tabular data (aka data that is stored in a table format). It shall start off with a note to the reader, going over how we are accessing `pandas` via jupyter notebooks and helpful tips/tricks if you choose to do the same.
