# Visualizations

This chapter will cover how to perform some basic visualizations in Python, covering basic libraries such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn` and also touching on more advanced libraries such as `plotly`. Once again, this chapter is not comprehensive, and practice is strongly encouraged.
