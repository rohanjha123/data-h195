# Installation

## Python

To install Python, you should download the installer for the appropriate version from [www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run the installer. Once you have run the installer, you can try entering `python --version` (or `python3 --version` if you installed a Python version greater than 3.0, which is recommended) in your terminal/command line to verify the installation worked.

After that, it is recommended you also install several packages to help interact with data. More information on how to use these packages can be found in the Syntax section, but for now I will just discuss how to install them. 

For this online book, you are only required to install `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `regex`, `seaborn` and `scikit-learn`, although it is also a good idea to explore and other packages like `scipy`, `plotly` if you wish. To install any of these packages, you can just type `pip install` followed by the package name in the terminal. For example, to install pandas, you would type `pip install pandas`.

I also recommend installing Jupyter Lab as it provides an interactive shell for you to easily conduct data analysis and look at what your data looks like. To do so, just type `pip install jupyter lab` like above. Once you have installed jupyter lab, you can start it by typing `jupyter lab` in your terminal. This should open up a Jupyter Lab environment in your default browser, allowing you to view/open various files and create new notebooks for data analysis. You can learn more about this on their [website](https://jupyter.org/).
