# <a> Data Science for Economists </a>

Data analysis is a key part of modern economics; economic theories must be tested with data to be accepted. As such, it is critically important for economists to learn some data science. UC Berkeley's [*Economics 148: Data Science for Economists*](https://www.econ148.org/) helps economics student learn the skills they need. This online textbook is written by a teaching assistant for that course in an attempt to help make the transition to data science easier. However, this textbook is not restricted to just students of economics 148, and instead can be viewed by anyone.

## A note on Python vs Stata

This book teaches data science concepts using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). However, until recently, [Stata](https://www.stata.com/) was the primary language used for economic research. When the book is fully complete, it shall include two chapters comparing Python and Stata. These chapters shall have two aims:
- inform young economists on the differences between the languages and help them convert from one language to the other.
- compare Python and Stata from a pedagogical perspective.
