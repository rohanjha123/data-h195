# <a> A Quick Overview </a>

In the early 1990s, Stata gained popularity as a tool for making data analysis easier for the social sciences, especially economics. Several prominent economists were trained in Stata, and the software is still widely used today among academic economists. However, key data analysis tools have also been introduced in other modern programming languages. Using a modern programming language instead of Stata would help users have access to a broader range of tools for data analysis and computer processing, rather than being restricted to the smaller set of capabilities affored by Stata. Additionally, while Stata requires ~$425 USD to purchase for students in the US, using a modern programming language would be free, thus making economic tools more accessible. To support this cause, this book is intended to help users transition from Stata to Python in particular.

## A Note to the Reader

This textbook is written assuming the reader has been trained in the tools of econometrics with Stata and would like to make the transition to Python. The first chapter will give a quick overview of the differences between Python and Stata, the second chapter will delve further into conducting econometric analysis in Python, and subsequent chapters will introduce the readers to additional tools in Python which are crucial for data analysis. Please note that this book only teaches you how to utilise econometric techniques with Python, it does not teach you what those techniques are and when it is appropriate to use them. If you are interested in learning quantitive economics and econometrics with Python, please consider [Intermediate Quantitative Economics with Python](https://python.quantecon.org/intro.html), made by [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/).
