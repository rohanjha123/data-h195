    "The underlying logic of this inverse relationship can be explained as follows: **when the demand for labor increases, the pool of unemployed workers subsequently decreases and companies increase wages to compete and attract a smaller talent pool. The cost of wages increases and companies pass along those costs to consumers in the form of price increases. Thus, a lower unemployment rate ultimately translates to a higher inflation.** \n",

    "Therefore, a given level of inflation will eventually be incorporated into the decision-making process and not affect the level of unemployment in the long run.

    "What this implies is that if the Central Bank would like to pin down inflation, they cannot do it by simply raising the interest rate (even though this is still an effective way in the short run). What is more important is to anchor people’s inflation expectations at a relatively low level. If they succeed, they can control inflation. This idea also appears to have been remarkably successful so far. Whenever it has shot above target, it has, soon enough, fallen back. \n",

But still the majority of economists are optimistic about this new Keynesian model. This is an ongoing research field. "
