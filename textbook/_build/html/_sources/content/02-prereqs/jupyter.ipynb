    "Throughout this textbook, we will be using [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to work with data. While you can use `pandas` without Jupyter notebooks, using notebooks is highly encouraged as it helps you interactively view datasets and easily see the results of multiple small iterations of data processing. If you do not already have Jupyter notebooks installed, you can see installation instructions [here](../01-python_v_stata/install.md)."

    "## Basic Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic layout of a Jupyter notebook is fairly intuitive. You can open multiple cells and perform different tasks in them. Each cell can either be a code cell, a markdown cell (often used for writing text, like the cell containing this paragraph), or a raw cell (don't worry about these for now). You can run each code cell, and you can also run the entire notebook in one go via the menu bar at the top. Feel free to explore the menu bar at the top to get a better idea of what all you can do!\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time you open a Jupyter notebook, you are assigned a kernel, which is a computational engine that executes the code contained in a notebook document. Each kernel has a RAM limit, be careful you don't exceed it! If you exceed it, your code will stop working. You can restart your kernel from the menu bar.\n",

    "\n",
    "Aside from keyboard shortcuts (specifically `Shift` + `Return`), you can also run a single cell by clicking the `Run` button in the menu bar at the top of your notebook. If you hover over the button, you will also find some other options that allow you to run multiple cells. Specifically, restarting your kernel clears all saved variables and frees up memory. The `Restart Kernel and Run upto Selected Cell` option is particularly useful for situations where you believe your code is fine but you're running into stange memory issues. "
