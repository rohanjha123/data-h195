Thus, it does not simulate a research project where you would go deep into one or two directions. Additionally, I see it as a nuisance to hand us a dataset without providing the full documentation. The appendix groups together some of the data – but this is the easily understandable data as it directly correlates to the questions. Why is 'order_c' ∈ {NaN, 1, 2, 3, 4}? What is '_merge', 'trr1', or 'assWG1'? Which column shows the results of the water analysis, or is this not in the data?
Q1.3 asks us to asses the granularity of the data – and identify a primary key, but without knowing the exact structure going through the ~7700 rows, it is nothing but a guess or trial and error.
Additionally, I would prefer an analysis with a more economic focus.","In Q3.8 and Q4, the ""lecture slides"" are where the Hawthorne effect is mentioned.
